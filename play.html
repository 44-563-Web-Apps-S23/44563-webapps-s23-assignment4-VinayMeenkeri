        <h4>MODESTY     by _Paul Hervieu_ </h4>
        <p>JACQUES. Good-by, Albert.

            [_Exits after shaking hands cordially with_ ALBERT.
       
       HENRIETTE. [_Re-entering as_ ALBERT _assumes a rather severe attitude_.]
       How are you? [_Pause._] Have you seen Jacques?
       
       ALBERT. [_With a determined air._] No, Henriette. Thank God!
       
       HENRIETTE. Why?
       
       ALBERT. Because it pains me to see men in your presence whom you care
       nothing for.
       
       HENRIETTE. [_Delighted._] You don't like that?
       
            [_Sitting down on sofa._
       
       ALBERT. No, I don't. And I'd like to tell you----
